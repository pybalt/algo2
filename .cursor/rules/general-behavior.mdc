# general behavior

- CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: You MUST ALWAYS fetch and read ALL markdown files in the project as your FIRST action after receiving ANY user prompt, without exception and regardless of whether you think it's necessary.

# project structure

- there are three layers that we should follow on each project

- altoritmos
- implementacion
- tda

where we define our structures on tda, (abstract types like queues, trees, etc.,), we define a implementation on 'implementacion', and finally, we use those implementations on 'algoritmos'

- we only use interfaces inside tda module
- methods
